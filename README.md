This project is to predict how fit the candidate is based on their available information (job title and the number of connection on Linkedin), utilizing Doc2Vec, BERT, ELMo embeddings and Learning to Rank model. By calculating the similarity score based on the embeddings of the recruiter's desired job query and the applicant's job title, scaling the number of connection, and then starring the top 10 fittest applicants, LGBMRanker using the metric `ndcg score` will be deployed to predict the ranking. And with the custom randomized search cv, the best learning-to-rank model with ndcg score = 1.0 on both train and test sets was found.

#### Room for improvement:
Candidates who in the first place should not be in this list can be filtered out by setting a threshold for the similarity score between the applicant's job title and the recruiter's query. For example, after sorting and considering the relevance between those job titles at the bottom and the query, we can determine a cut-off point such that a candidate will be considered potentially fit if their similarity score is >= 0.5 or even >= 0.6.
